# Requirements

Spark requires Java 8 and Python 2.7+/3.4+.

# Setup

Make sure that `setup.sh` is executable

```
chmod a+x setup.sh
```

and run

```
source ./setup.sh
```

The script will download Spark and add it to PATH.
It will also set some sensible environment variables
and download an exemplary dataset.
